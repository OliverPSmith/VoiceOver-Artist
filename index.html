            <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
            <p>I am a professional British female voiceover artist and have been working in the 
                industry since 2016. My experience spans, Commercials, E-Learning content, adult 
                and children’s narrations, corporate work, IVR, comedy and drama radio plays and 
                everything in between. In that time, I have worked for companies including, Colgate, 
                Corsodyl, OLA Driver, Boots and Spotify. <br><br>
                Since completing my training in <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more-text"> Musical theatre at Guildford School of Acting in 2012,
                I have been working in the performing arts sector. My experience as an actor has 
                provided me with an excellent foundation in storytelling, building characters and 
                understanding the essence and tone to convey with your words. I take direction well 
                and I can help you create exactly what you’re looking for to bring your script to life. 
                I enjoy working closely with my clients, so they walk away satisfied that my voice is 
                selling their brand as they envisioned it. If you aren’t sure what your vision is, I also 
                love to play and will work with you to find <i>your</i> sound. <br><br>
                I was born and raised in Surrey, England meaning I naturally have that appealing, neutral 
                British accent which is a great fit for all sorts of genres of Voiceover. My light RP 
                sound is easily adaptable to your needs, whether you’re after a professional sound or 
                something more casual I can hit just the right note for you. Have a little listen to my 
                audio reels where you can hear my versatility in range from Calm and Sophisticated to 
                Upbeat and Friendly, Serious and Empathic to Comical and Characterful. <br><br>
